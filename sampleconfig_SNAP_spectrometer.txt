# This is a sample file of configuration parameters for the UTMOST2D firmware.
# It will be read by the code that programs the FPGA and configures the f-engine and packetiser.
# Comments are allowed as entire lines, but not at the end of a line.
# Parameter values may be short python expressions which do not include the character '='.
# The parameters may be defined in any order.

# What the parser will do:
# 1. Read lines as strings.
# 2. Throw away blank lines and lines that start with '#'.
# 3. Separate each string into a keyword string and a value string, and then evaluate the value string.
# 4. Make a dictionary of keys and values.
# 5. Check that every keyword is a valid parameter and that every required parameter has a value.  


PI_IP = '10.66.146.30'
#string, IP of host raspberry pi

BOFFILE = 'spectrometer_new4_2017-2-6_1437.bof'
#string, name of bof

SNAPID = 0xff
#8 bit integer, identifies this particular snap board

SNAPMAC = 0x02020a000002 
#48 bit integers, MAC for SNAP

SNAPIP  = 0x0a000001 
# 32 bit integer, IP address of SNAP

SNAPPORT = 50000   
#integer, port number for ethernet1 to send from

DESTMACS = [0x0060DD46BFD9 for i in range(256)]
#List of 256 48 bit integers, lists all destination MAC addresses for ethernet1.

DESTINATION_IP_ADDRESSES = [0x0a000003]*10 
#list of 32-bit integers, lists destination IP addresses in order of corresponding subbands. The first 10 are for ethernet1, the last 10 for ethernet2.

DESTINATION_PORTS = [50000]*10
#list of integers, lists destination ports in order of corresponding subbands. The first 10 are for ethernet 1, the last 10 are for ethernet 2.

# Define band to send
START_CHANNEL = 330
# Lowest channel number of the set of 320 channels to send.
