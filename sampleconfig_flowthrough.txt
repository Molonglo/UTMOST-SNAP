# This is a sample file of configuration parameters for the UTMOST2D firmware.
# It will be read by the code that programs the FPGA and configures the f-engine and packetiser.
# Comments are allowed as entire lines, but not at the end of a line.
# Parameter values may be short python expressions which do not include the character '='.
# The parameters may be defined in any order.

# What the parser will do:
# 1. Read lines as strings.
# 2. Throw away blank lines and lines that start with '#'.
# 3. Separate each string into a keyword string and a value string, and then evaluate the value string.
# 4. Make a dictionary of keys and values.
# 5. Check that every keyword is a valid parameter and that every required parameter has a value.
